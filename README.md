# Megagame Dashboard

A web app to display an up-to-date dashboard of vital information during a [megagame](https://sydneymegagamers.com/whats-a-megagame/).

## Components

Each dashboard can have information handled as distinct components.

### Timers

Define a set of timers for the round structure of the game. The current round timer displays as a countdown on the dashboard.

### Media feed

Allow your in-game media team to post messages, that display in a scrolling media feed on the dashboard.
